JeeLabs collectors.
===================
Introduction:
-------------

This directory contains the OPhomo code to use JeeLabs JeeNodes as sensors for monitoring. It contains three parts:
 - The SensorNodes
   Arduino code for sensors. 
 - The CollectorNodes
   Arduino code for a collector, a JeeNode which communicates with the SensorNodes.
 - The CollectorHost
   Standard C/C++ code to communicate between a host and a collector node.

Directories:
------------
This directory contains the following subdirectories:
CollectorHost
+++++++++++++
The code for the CollectorHost. Based on autoconf/automake project but probably easy to convert to a MSVC, ... project. I will try mingw soon.

docs
++++
Documentation I found interesting for this project.

libraries
+++++++++
Arduino libraries I use for both Nodes

sketch
++++++
Arduino sketches, containing also the sensor and collector node code.
